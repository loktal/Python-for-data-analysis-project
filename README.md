# Python for data analysis project: dataset starcraft 2 
We had a dataset on the ranking of players in starcraft 2, so in this classification probleme we had to predict the rank of the players thanks to our dataset and create the best possible predictive model. We also had to make a flask API so the players can know theirs ranks thanks to our predictive model.
