# Python for data analysis project: dataset starcraft 2 
We had a dataset on the ranking of players in starcraft 2, so in this classification probleme we had to predict the rank of the players (bronze(1) to pro(8)) thanks to our dataset and create the best possible predictive model. We also had to make a flask API so the players can know theirs ranks thanks to our predictive model. After several Data visualisation, we had chosen the rabdom forest model for its high accuracy and its maniability. We have done a background selection and we have found the best parameters with a grid search for our random foerest model. After a cross validation model we have found an accuracy of 75,57 %.
